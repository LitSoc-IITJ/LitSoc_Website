        description: "The Word Games Club, Sphinx, is a place where you can challenge your cleverness and vocabulary through witty puzzles like cryptic crossies, rebuses, anagrams, scrabble, Pictionary, and many others. Cryptic crosswords are crosswords in which each clue is a word puzzle in itself. Unlike regular crossword clues, cryptic crossword clues are designed to be deliberately obscure, using wordplay and other tricks to hide the true meaning of the clue. Anagrams are words or phrases that are formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. Scrabble is a board game in which players use letter tiles to form words on a game board. Pictionary is a party game that involves drawing pictures to convey words or phrases to other players, who must guess what the drawing represents.",
